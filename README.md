# 🌞 Solar-Tracker-ECE

**Ongoing ECE project**: A single-axis solar tracker using LDR sensors and servo motor to align a solar panel with the sun.

## 🔧 Overview

This tracker system uses:
- 2 LDRs to detect sunlight intensity
- Arduino UNO for signal processing
- Servo motor to rotate the panel
- Breadboard setup with real-time feedback

## 🚀 Goal

To optimize solar panel efficiency by aligning with the sun using simple control logic. Built as part of hands-on embedded systems learning.

## 📅 Status

🛠️ Project currently under development — final circuit and simulation will be uploaded here soon.

## 📄 Files (To be added)
- `solar_tracker.ino` – Arduino code
- `circuit_diagram.png` – Tinkercad circuit
- `media/` – Demo photos & videos
